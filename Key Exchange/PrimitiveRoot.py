                    PRIMITIVE ROOTS
            
            Let n be an integer. 
            Let G be the set of numbers relatively prime to n.
            G contains phi(n) elements (phi: Euler totient)
            If n is a prime than G = {1,2,3,...,p-1}
            
            G is a multiplicative group mod n
            Primitive root is element g of group for which
            every other element of the group is a power of g mod n
            
            g**1, g**2, ... , g**phi(n)
            
            Prime Numbers always have a primitive root
